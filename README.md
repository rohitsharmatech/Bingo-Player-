# Bingo-Player
This manual will guide you through playing the Bingo game in two modes: a Terminal-based 
version and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. You can choose to play using the 
terminal for a text-based experience or use the GUI for a more interactive experience with 
graphical elements.
System Requirements
• A computer with Python 3.x installed.
• Necessary Python libraries: random, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statistics, tabulate, 
scipy. Python's pip package manager can be used to install these.
• Any standard terminal application for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Installation and Setup
• Downloading the Game Files: Obtain the run_on_terminal.py and logic_bingo.py files.
• These can be downloaded from a provided source or received via email.
• Installing Python Libraries: Open your terminal and install the required libraries by 
executing the following command:
 “pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy”
Throughout this process, make sure you have a working internet connection.
Playing the game
Terminal Version
Launching the Game: Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing 
run_on_terminal.py, and execute the script using python run_on_terminal.py.
Gameplay:
• Enter the number of Bingo cards and the number of simulations when prompted.
• The game will simulate Bingo rounds and display statistical analyses and histograms.
• Enter the number of numbers called for detailed centrality figures. Depending on the 
game's flow, you might be asked to input more information like the number of numbers 
called. Provide this as prompted.
• After the simulations, the game will display various statistical analyses in your terminal. 
This includes histograms, centrality figures, and other relevant data.
• Exiting the Game: Once you have finished reviewing the results, you can close the 
terminal to exit the game.
GUI Version
Launching the Game: Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing GUI.py,

Additional Features
• Terminal Version: Includes detailed statistical analysis and visual histograms.
• GUI Version: Interactive graphical analysis and PDF export functionality for Bingo
